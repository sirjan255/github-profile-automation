# GitHub Profile Automation

This project automates the daily updates of your GitHub profile. It uses a GitHub Action to fetch your daily activity (commits) and updates the profileâ€™s `activity.md` file with the latest commit information. The goal of this repository is to keep your GitHub profile up to date with your activity automatically.

## Features
- Fetches the last 24 hours' commits from your GitHub account using the GitHub API.
- Updates the `activity.md` file with your daily commit messages.
- Automates the update process using GitHub Actions, running every day at midnight or on-demand.
- Utilizes a Python script to retrieve and write the commit messages to the `activity.md` file.
- A `.gitignore` file tailored for Python projects that ensures unnecessary files do not get pushed to the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A GitHub account and an active repository.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sirjan255/github-profile-automation.git
   cd github-profile-automation
   ```

2. Set up your Python environment. You can use `venv` or any environment manager:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file to store your GitHub Personal Access Token (`GH_TOKEN`). You can generate a token by visiting [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

## GitHub Actions Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically updates your `activity.md` file every day at midnight. The workflow can also be manually triggered from the GitHub interface.

### Workflow Overview
- **Name**: Update GitHub Profile
- **Triggers**:
  - Automatically runs every day at midnight via cron.
  - Can be triggered manually via the GitHub UI (`workflow_dispatch`).
  
### Workflow Steps:
1. **Checkout Repository**: Checks out the code from the repository.
2. **Set up Python**: Installs Python in the GitHub Actions environment.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Installs the required Python dependencies (`requests` library).
4. **Run Update Script**: Executes the Python script that fetches the last 24 hours' commits and writes them to `activity.md`.
5. **Commit and Push Changes**: Commits the updated `activity.md` file and pushes it to the repository.

## Python Script

The Python script `scripts/update_profile.py` fetches the latest commits from the GitHub API and updates the `activity.md` file with the commit messages.

### Key Functions:

- **`get_commits()`**: 
  - Fetches the user's events (commits) from the GitHub API.
  - Filters out only `PushEvent` types (commits) from the events in the last 24 hours.

- **`update_activity()`**:
  - Calls `get_commits()` and writes the commit messages to the `activity.md` file.

### Usage:
To run the script manually, you can execute:
```bash
python scripts/update_profile.py
```

### Example Output (`activity.md`):
```markdown
# Daily GitHub Activity

## Commits
- Fixed bug in authentication module
- Updated documentation for user guide
- Added feature for push notifications
```

## GitHub Token

This project requires a GitHub Personal Access Token (`GH_TOKEN`) to fetch the commit data via GitHub's API.

### Setting up the GitHub Token:
1. Go to [GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to create a new token.
2. Store the token in your repository's **Secrets** (under **Settings > Secrets**):
   - **Name**: `GH_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: Paste your personal access token here.

The token is required for authentication when making API requests to GitHub.

## Using the `.gitignore`

This repository includes a `.gitignore` file specifically tailored for Python projects. The `.gitignore` file ensures that unnecessary or sensitive files (e.g., compiled code, environment directories, logs, etc.) are not tracked in version control.

### Key Sections of `.gitignore`:
- **Compiled Python files**: Ignores bytecode files like `*.pyc` and directories like `__pycache__/`.
- **Environment files**: Ignores virtual environment directories such as `.env`, `.venv`, `env/`, and `venv/`.
- **Build/Distribution Files**: Ignores build-related directories and files (e.g., `dist/`, `build/`, `.egg-info/`).
- **Test-related Files**: Ignores test reports and coverage files generated by tools like `pytest`, `tox`, and `nose`.
- **IDE-specific Files**: Ignores project settings for IDEs like PyCharm (`.idea/`) and Spyder (`.spyderproject`).

This `.gitignore` ensures that your repository only contains the essential source code and not unnecessary temporary or configuration files.
